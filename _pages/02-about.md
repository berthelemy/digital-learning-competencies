At Wyver Solutions, we have led and supported learning technology projects since 2006.

Our founder, Mark Berthelemy, has spent over 30 years involved at the intersection of education, business and learning technology.

We want to support the next generation of elearning specialists to create learning experiences, resources and systems that make a difference.

Our open source [competency framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/competencies) has been created by and for the industry. It sets the standard for professionals working in a broad range of roles across the elearning industry.

Our free [self-assessment]({{ site.baseurl }}/assessment) tools and challenging [coaching programme](/coaching) are designed to help you develop further.

Our [certifications]({{ site.baseurl }}/certification) provide the evidence you need to show that you have broad and deep skills in elearning.
